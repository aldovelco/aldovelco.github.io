  <h1 class="title">About</h1>
    <p>I'm a software developer who cares about delivering quality products that satisfies client's needs. I am used to working on time constrained projects and thrive in such environments. One of my hobbies is keeping up with new trends and technologies because I have a knack for learning. Finally, I'd love to find a company in which I can further develop my skills and advance in my career.</p>
